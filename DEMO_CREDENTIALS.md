## Important Notes

⚠️ **Before Seeding**
- Make sure email confirmation is disabled in Lovable Cloud settings for faster testing
- The seeding process will fail if accounts already exist
- Clear existing data before re-seeding

🔒 **Security**
- These are demo credentials only
- Never use these passwords in production
- Always change default credentials in production environments

🚀 **Development Mode**
- The seed button only appears when `NODE_ENV=development`
- In production builds, the `/seed-data` route is still accessible but not promoted via UI

## Troubleshooting

**"Demo accounts already exist" error**
- Log out of all accounts
- Delete existing users from the database
- Try seeding again

**"Rate limiting" errors**
- Wait 1-2 minutes between seeding attempts
- The service includes automatic delays to prevent rate limiting

**Accounts created but no data**
- Check backend logs for errors
- Ensure user IDs are correctly retrieved
- Verify database permissions for all tables
